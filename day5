#AUGUST 28 2025
**today my day was hectic. boring college with no experienced faculty or helpful seniors. doing everything on my own, I'm happy that I'm working on myself taking online lectures and coding along yet I'm not proud of myself. I need to do more and gain more knowledge day by day. this GitHub stream I'm maintaining just to not stop coding no matter if it's a line. today I've done only 1 and a half lecture done. because of chaos in my hostel room and some notes writing and homework related to college. i did code but only for 40 minutes I guess. 
** what I've learnt today: today I was working on my first portfolio building using html and css. then I'll hop on Java
and i hope that I won't be stuck in java as it's know as one of the difficult languages to learn.
