#August 30 2025
**what I've learnt today: today i built my own portfolio which was not that good yet still it's my first big project. I have a upcoming hackathon in October month on 6-7th I guess. my speed is not that good and i don't know how am I gonna complete it in 24 hours and how I'm gonna make it a responsive website. yet in excited. and I'm also gonna participate in a internship programme in September itself on Tuesday which is on September 2nd, it will go until 7 weeks. I'm very very curious and I'll add my portfolio here soon.
