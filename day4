** today was hectic, my clg sucks as well. today was my second of college (as I'm from a tier 3 clg I can't expect much).
I came back to my room after lunch even though classes were till 4pm (those are not classes just time waste because no faculty will teach after lunch, idk why probably it's because of the first days difficulties).
anyway, i had many other works to do which made me unavailable for the remaining day. but i still didn't break my streak. everyday i atleast take 8-10 lectures but today I only attended 5. i stopped at 6th because I don't want to pressurize myself at the nights because it won't be useful (I won't remember when I do stuff when my brain is obviously trying to sleep). 
anyway, see you tomorrow.
