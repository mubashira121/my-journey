# DAY1: august 16, 2025
**today's progress : i set up my github profile properly and completed my lectures for the day from udemy by harris ali khan (ultimate web development course 2025 - build modern websites)
**today what i've learnt: how to code out a form.  we need forms to get the data from data base. input is a self closing tag wherease label needs a closing tag. 
**my thoughts: it was fun.
