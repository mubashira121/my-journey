#day3(August 25)
**My apologies for breaking the streak yesterday of 24th of August. but on August 25 I'm continuing it again. I've completed 34 lectures out of 130 till now. so far I'm glad that I'm improving day by day. I lack of consistency but I'm working on it. this under15days course completing challenge would be done soon. 
before everything, i applied for a online beginner friendly hackathon which is on October 6-7 where I have 2 months to prepare. 
because I can only work and concentrate in a challenging environment, so I had to apply even though I've never done it before. anyway, see you tomorrow.
